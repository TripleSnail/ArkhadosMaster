# Arkhados Master #

[Arkhados'](https://github.com/TripleSnail/Arkhados) master server.

Master server's purposes in order of importance:
1. Make it easy to find and join games.
2. Make it easy to host games by eliminating the need for port forwarding.

The important thing about the master server is that it doesn't host your games. It just keeps a list of games so that it's easy to find them and it makes hosting game easy by implementing a NAT hole punching system.
